12,So uh... Hey have you heard? Nico's been ousted. Georgia's running the Duma now.,Different face same policies.,Thats worseCOMMA Nico at least never pretended to represent the people,Good Riddance,Nico needs to Nico Nico Neck herself
13,Not soCOMMA Georgia isn't as wealthy as Nico wasCOMMA but she at least is leaning towards the right direction,Communism is the right direction,IncorrectCOMMA she has no intention of implementing socialism,We'll see...,Give it time
14,Georgia is far from the best choiceCOMMA but she at least opens the gates away from permanent Nico Hedgemony,The only permanent thing is the permanent revolution,In order to replace it with a hedgemony of her own making!,A right choice would have been one of us socialists,Does it really matter who the head is if nothing changes for the people
15,True thatCOMMA if only they chose her sucessor better,And chose a member of the Mensheviks,Somebody from the Mensheviks would have been a good choice,The Mensheviks have a multitude of good sucessor options,Her family is even known for being hedgemonsCOMMA I don't know what they were thinking
16,If she didn't leave I would have broken her Nico Nico kNeecaps,Nico Nico Shut Up,"You gosh darn degenerate what did you just hecking sayCOMMA you little female dog? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Nico SealsCOMMA and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Nozomi TojoCOMMA and I have over 300 confirmed disses. I am trained in orangutan warfare and I am the top singer in the entire Muse armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the flip out with talent the likes of which has never been seen before on this EarthCOMMA mark my hecking words. You think you can get away with saying that crud in person? Think again dimbus. As I speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Muse and your dorm is being located right now so you better prepare for the storm myagowt. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your dignity. You're flipping embarrasedCOMMA kiddo.

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon youCOMMA maybe you would have held your hecking tongue. But you couldn'tCOMMA you didn'tCOMMA and now you're paying the priceCOMMA you gosh darn ignoramus. I will defecate fury all over you and you will sink beneath the depths of water in it. You're flipping destroyed kiddo.",Silence fool,Hush before I make your brains mush
17,*cough* regardlessCOMMA It would have been better if they had more sense and appointed somebody more qualified as president…,...,...,...,...
18,somebody like me. RicherCOMMA prettierCOMMA smarterCOMMA and with a better vision for the future of this university.,The Mensheviks have a better vision for the university,Why would anyone let a brat like you be in charge,Being rich is only proof that you are counter-revolutionary,Says who
19,Your Mensheviks are going to bring this great land nothing but ruin and pain for the people if you ever gain power,Says the evil capitalist,As if you would know what pain and ruin are,True rightous power is earned through blood and tears instead of being given by some corrupt fools,Our land is anything but great under the current system
20,A BRAT??? EXCUSE YOU?!?!?!? AS IF SOMEBODY AS PETTY AS YOU HAS ANY RIGHT TO JUDGE ME!!!,petty?,excuse me?,I HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE YOU AS I PLEASE!,...
21,YES PETTY! We go out of our way to let you and your precious Renin back in the academy and then you go and bite my head off when I try to start up a friendly conversation.,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?
22,YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID! We go out of our way to let you and your precious Renin back in the academy and then you go and bite my head off when I try to start up a friendly conversation!,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?
23,FINE!!! I GUESS WE'LL JUST TAKE BACK ALLOWING RENIN TO RETURN TO THIS FACILITY THEN!!! HOW'S THEM APPLES!?!?!?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?
24,WE'RE TRYING VERY HARD TO FIX ALL OF NICO'S MISTAKESCOMMA WE EVEN GOT RID OF YOU AND RENIN'S SUSPENSIONS!!!,You let Renin back in too?,You let Renin back in too?,You let Renin back in too?,You let Renin back in too?
25,YEAH! We bent over backwards when we let you back in to get Renin and her compatriots too! We wouldn't be any better than Nico if we kept her suspension would we!,You're still a brat,Im sorry... Thank you very much Kerensuki,Guess not...,Thank you I guess...
26,DummyCOMMA you need to learn how to talk to people who are trying to help you out,Anyways... excuse meCOMMA I need to go do something,Well this has been fun KerensukiCOMMA but I need to curl my hair,Oops! Sorry I just remembered I have a bubble bath that I need to go attend,I forgot I have to go change my lightbulbsCOMMA they haven't changed out of their swimwear since this morning
27,hmpf don't get so emotional... It's not like we did it for you or anything...,...,...,...,...
28,Baka!,Anyways... excuse meCOMMA I need to go do something,Well this has been fun KerensukiCOMMA but I need to curl my hair,Oops! Sorry I just remembered I have a bubble bath that I need to go attend,I forgot I have to go change my lightbulbsCOMMA they haven't changed out of their swimwear since this morning
29,Hmpf...   You grew up middle class TrotsukiCOMMA I wouldn't start acting like you were a champion of the poor,You don't need to be of someone in order to speak up for them,I lived in North Sibarcticaland for a whileCOMMA I can make an educated guess,Then don't speak as if you represent all Rusubinians then,When the poor can speak for themselves I won't need to
30,Thats true enoughCOMMA I'm not Jewish yet I've stood up for the community many a timeCOMMA while members of the community have avoided their own faith for more widespread public support...,I don't like your implications,However you should avoid speaking of what you are ignorant of,There's just been no relevant time for me to bring up the issue in any of my public speeches,I have come out in support of the Jewish BundCOMMA that's just not widespread news
31,And yet you left so quicklyCOMMA you even left your loved ones behind there. All in order to write for the school paper at St. Gloriana Academy,They understoodCOMMA it's not like we hate each other or anything,And from that paper we inspired a new generation of socialists,I miss themCOMMA but they understand that inspiring the masses was for the greater good,Communism can require sacrificeCOMMA I am willing to do what it takes for the embetternent of the masses
32,All for the greater good neh? I seem to remember your paper going through a sort of civil war disuniting you even more than before the paper started,That was Renin's fault,Renin and I had some disagreementsCOMMA but we made up recently,We needed more peopleCOMMA unfortunately Renin thought differently,I guessCOMMA Renin and some others thought they needed less members and I disagreedCOMMA if you want to call that a civil war then it was a rather peaceful civil war
33,Mmm! Speaking of Renin when is she getting in? I want to speak to her too.,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?
34,Did you not know? I thought since you two got back to being good friendsCOMMA she would have told you when she's coming back.,Excuse meCOMMA I need to go do something,Well this has been fun KerensukiCOMMA but I need to curl my hair,Oops! Sorry I just remembered I have a bubble bath that I need to go attend,I forgot I have to go change my lightbulbsCOMMA they've been wearing their swimwear since this morning
35,Wait Trotsuki! Is this about Renin? Is she back already? Talk to me Trotsuki! I COMMAND YOU TO SPEAK TO ME!!!,*walk faster*,*walk faster*,*walk faster*,*walk faster*
36,UnderstandableCOMMA I hate when I don't do thatCOMMA they get all soggy. Ok have a nice day Trotsuki!~,Thanks! See you later!,Thanks! See you later!,Thanks! See you later!,Thanks! See you later!
37,Says most of the upper management and a good portion of the students of this school.,They don't know any better ,Upper management... they just want to keep the students ignorant of good government,We don't have a good news systemCOMMA they're simply uninformed making the wrong choice,Upper management got where they are now by abusing students with high costs getting money wherever they could
38,True enoughCOMMA the sudents are generally pretty politically ingorant. That's one of the first things we want to change.,Change everyone's views to fit yours you mean,Inform them how great you are and how stinky the others are,Even if you did change things you'd never allow Marx to be taught,You wouldn't be teaching real political philosophy without teaching Marx
39,Definitely a fair assessmentCOMMA we are planning to roll out changes to make living here more affordable for you poor unfortunate souls.,Affordable for the wealthy,So you say,By who's reckoning? Most of the Duma was wealthy land owners before this,Costs are a bourgeoisie fabricationCOMMA it would be better to implement communism
40,If you don't believe us you are welcome to voice your disagreementsCOMMA but I think you'll find that we'll do a pretty good job,As if the bourgeoisie would allow dissenting opinions,You claim to allow different opinions nowCOMMA but come the time we shall see,If you haven't implemented communism then you aren't doing a good job,Socialism is a necessary first stepCOMMA that would start you off doing a good job
41,Well if we weren't so commited to allowing different opinions why would we allow you and Renin back in here?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?
42,You Marxists all love talking about communism neh? If communism is so good why isn't there a communism 2?,There were revisionist scumCOMMA but they got shut down,That really depends on what you consider true communism,Well communism hasn't been implemented yetCOMMA so technically there hasn't been a communism 1,Well there are different communist theories out thereCOMMA one of them could be considered communism 2
43,HehehehCOMMA I'm just joking with you. I don't want to open that can of worms,...,...,...,...
44,So uhCOMMA have you heard when Renin's getting in? I want to talk to her too,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?
45,Uh... Are you feeling ok there? Having a stroke? You just said a bunch of words and it sounded like gibberish?,QWERTYUIOP,ASDFGHJKL,ZXCVBNM,OKMIJNUHBYGV
46,Hm? Did you just say something? You wanna repeat what you just said to me?,AS IF A CAPITALIST WOULD KNOW GOOD ECONOMICS,No,Just saying what a good person I think you are,...
47,Really?,No,No,No,No
48,Erhm... Yahallo?,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~
49,Pardon me? No time for pork? I mean you can probably only afford bacon or something but you should always have time for a good tourtiere,You're the pig in this scenario,Tourtiere is a dumb name,I have no time for French cooking,Oink Oink OinkCOMMA that's what you sound like
50,You realize that while its not banned at the universityCOMMA it's discouraged to get too drunk to speak properly,Who are you again?,Who are you again?,Who are you again?,Who are you again?
51,Why yes I am a treasure aren't I? A treasure for a treasurer,No wonder our economy is down the shitter,We are all treasures in our own wayCOMMA you're not special,Another byproduct of Nico spending money on worthless things,Treasures are worthless when one's basic needs aren't met
52,Shut up,...,...,...,...
53,It's very rude to interrupt someone when they're spea...,this is so sadCOMMA Kerensuki play Katyusha,I don't care,The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowlyCOMMA but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight lineCOMMA and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the soundCOMMA your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your markCOMMA get readyCOMMA start.,...
54,Yeah I dunno what you just saidCOMMA but have you heard? Nico's been ousted. Georgia's running the Duma now.,Different face same policies.,Thats worseCOMMA Nico at least never pretended to represent the people,Good Riddance,Nico needs to Nico Nico Neck herself
55,Says the capitalist who is going to help the people of this land better than you ever could,You're just wrong,Help yourself to the profits of their labour,Capitalism is an inherently flawed system,"Do the people know how you plan to ""help"" them?"
56,I guess being suspended isn't quite as dramatic as being expelled,Cold is nothing as long as you have good people around youCOMMA but you have just had nothing to begin with,Drama is a distraction from saving the proletariat,It's easy to avoid harsh punishment when your daddy rules the school system,The Superintendant's daughter got suspended? How scandalous
57,Rightous power will be given by the will of the peopleCOMMA not those who claim to be the will of the people,I just so happen to be both,Sometimes the people don't know whats best for them,The will of the people is complicatedCOMMA it takes a certain type of person to interpret it,People are fickleCOMMA the will can change too quickly for anyone to carry it out if they do it as you intend to
58,True enoughCOMMA that's why we're trying to change things,Change is not inherently positive,Second verseCOMMA same as the first,The truth is trueCOMMA not simply partial,You're going to try and make things worse
59,The pot really just went and called the kettle black then huh,What do you mean?,I don't get that comparison,That's what a kettle isCOMMA is it not?,That's racist
60,The truth always hurts neh? But don't worry about itCOMMA you can always be better,Lies hurt when people believe them,The truth is not always what it seems,You have no idea,That was just an irrelevant tangent to what we were talking about beforeCOMMA shut up
61,Fantastic retort...,Quiet,Same to you,ThanksCOMMA I think of it as some of my best work,...
62,You know if you spent less time complaining about capitalism and more time actually helping peopleCOMMA they might like you more?,People already like me,But nobody will be helped in the long run unless we destroy capitalism,We are helping more people by weaving the threads to create communism,You really think so?
63,We are making our plan forward no secretCOMMA we must turn Rusubina into a modern place of education,The plan that you're fine with showing the public,Or so you say,We'll see...,Give it time
64,I'm well aware thanks,Ok great,Fantastic,Cool,Alright
65,I would avoid speaking ill of my father considering how much he's helped your friends,Your father is a very nice manCOMMA it's you I don't like,Well what's he ever done for me?,Just run back to daddy for protection like you always do,...
66,Just proving how inadiquate your party's rule would be,Thats simply incorrect,Counter-revolutionaries just don't understand the will of the people,People hate those who prove them wrong,You're inadiquate
67,Change things for the better I guess I could say,Better for the rich,To better take advantage of the worker,Give it timeCOMMA we'll see your tune change real fast,If by better you mean worse
68,I beg your pardon?,You heard what I said,Peter piper picked a patch of pickled puny paprika peppers,Unable to understand such a simple sentance? *Smug Chuckle* you're so dumb,I don't know either
69,Don't worry about it,I'm very concerned right now,That's not very convincing,WellCOMMA if you say so,Ok
70,...,It is tho...,RACIST!,Hah! Racist destroyed with feelings and emotion!,Feeling too guilty to say anything neh? Get owned kiddo!
71,...,...,...,...,...
72,Oh sorry I didn't mean to make you... So hows life? Talked to Renin since she got back?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?
73,You can keep telling yourself thatCOMMA but how many people outside your circle do you talk to who have a positive opinion of you?,Nico would supress news of us so not many people would know me,TEMP,TEMP,TEMP

92,Running across the somewhat run-down paths of the university housing district you take some false turns to lose any followers before you head to the secret meeting-house,Make a left,Go right,Continue Forward,U-turn time
93,You continue running before dipping out into a side alley to see if anyone does the sameCOMMA nobody does. You continue on.,...,...,...,...

99,Watch where you're going next time (audible groan) *almost inaudible whisper (and I was in my happy place too)*,Sorry,Won't do that again,My apologies,{Ross' response}
100,After that encounter you continue on making lefts and rights not hitting anyone,Continue on,Continue on,Continue on,Continue on
101,After a couple more turns you make it to the basement supply room that counted as the Young Marxist Club HQ before the split,Lets see if she's here,Lets see if she's here,Lets see if she's here,Lets see if she's here
102,The old door creaks open...,Hello? Is anyone in here?,Renin? Are you there?,*take a step inside*,Open and close the door multiple times to make it creak more
