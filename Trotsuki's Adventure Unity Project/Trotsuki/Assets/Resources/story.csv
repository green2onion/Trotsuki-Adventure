1,Walking out of their sociology class one of Trotsuki's classmates heard her impassioned speech on the benefits of communismCOMMA and wants to know more,You have nothing to lose but your chains,Everyone should embrace communism,Communism deprives man of the power to subjugate the labour of others,Then the world will be for the common peopleCOMMA and all will be happy,Narrator,15
2,Hahaha hey there.,:),8^),;),}= 0,Kerensuki,7

10,As the better person I will turn the other cheek and give you a chance to rectify your behaviour.,*Death Stare*,Reactionaries like you are worse people in every regard,FineCOMMA truce,...,Kerensuki,15
11,Have you heard? Nico got ousted. Georgia's running the Duma now.,Different face same policies.,that's worseCOMMA Nico at least never pretended to represent the people,Good Riddance,Nico needs to Nico Nico Neck herself,Kerensuki,15
12,So uh... Hey have you heard? Nico's been ousted. Georgia's running the Duma now.,Different face same policies.,that's worseCOMMA Nico at least never pretended to represent the people,Good Riddance,Nico needs to Nico Nico Neck herself,Kerensuki,15
13,Not soCOMMA Georgia isn't as wealthy as Nico wasCOMMA but she at least is leaning towards the right direction.,Communism is the right direction,IncorrectCOMMA she has no intention of implementing socialism,We'll see...,Give it time,Kerensuki,15
14,Georgia is far from the best choiceCOMMA but she at least opens the gates away from permanent Nico Hedgemony.,The only permanent thing is the permanent revolution,In order to replace it with a hedgemony of her own making!,A right choice would have been one of us socialists,Does it really matter who the head is if nothing changes for the people,Kerensuki,15
15,True thatCOMMA if only they chose her sucessor better.,And chose a member of the Mensheviks,Somebody from the Mensheviks would have been a good choice,The Mensheviks have a multitude of good sucessor options,Her family has a bad reputationCOMMA they musn't have been thinking,Kerensuki,20
16,If she didn't leave I would have broken her Nico Nico kNeecaps.,Nico Nico Shut Up,I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Nico SealsCOMMA and I've been...,Silence fool,Hush before I make your brains mush,Kerensuki,15

18,somebody like me. RicherCOMMA prettierCOMMA smarterCOMMA and with a better vision for the future of this university.,The Mensheviks have a better vision for the university,Why would anyone let a brat like you be in charge,Being rich is only proof that you are counter-revolutionary,Says who,Kerensuki,20
19,Your Mensheviks are going to bring this great land nothing but ruin and pain for the people if you ever gain power.,Says the evil capitalist,As if you would know what pain and ruin are,Rightous power is earned through blood instead of a gift from corrupt fools,Our land is anything but great under the current system,Kerensuki,20
20,A BRAT??? EXCUSE YOU?!?!?!? AS IF SOMEBODY AS PETTY AS YOU HAS ANY RIGHT TO JUDGE ME!!!,petty?,excuse me?,I HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE YOU AS I PLEASE!,...,Kerensuki,15
21,YES PETTY! We go out of our way to let you and your precious Renin back in the academy and then you go and bite my head off when I try to start up a friendly conversation.,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Kerensuki,15
22,YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID! We go out of our way to let you and your precious Renin back in the academy and then you go and bite my head off when I try to start up a friendly conversation!,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Renin is back too!?,Kerensuki,15
23,FINE!!! I GUESS WE'LL JUST TAKE BACK ALLOWING RENIN TO RETURN TO THIS FACILITY THEN!!! HOW'S THEM APPLES!?!?!?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Kerensuki,15
24,WE'RE TRYING VERY HARD TO FIX ALL OF NICO'S MISTAKESCOMMA WE EVEN GOT RID OF YOU AND RENIN'S SUSPENSIONS!!!,You let Renin back in too?,You let Renin back in too?,You let Renin back in too?,You let Renin back in too?,Kerensuki,15
25,YEAH! We bent over backwards when we let you all back in! We wouldn't be any better than Nico if we kept her suspension would we!,You're still a brat,Im sorry... Thank you very much Kerensuki,Guess not...,Thank you I guess...,Kerensuki,12
26,DummyCOMMA you need to learn how to talk to people who are trying to help you out.,Anyways... excuse meCOMMA I need to go do something,Well this has been fun KerensukiCOMMA but I need to curl my hair,Oops! Sorry I just remembered I have a bubble bath that I need to go attend,I forgot I have to go change my lightbulbsCOMMA they haven't changed out of their swimwear since this morning,Kerensuki,20
27,hmpf don't get so emotional... It's not like we did it for you or anything...,...,...,...,...,Kerensuki,7
28,Baka!,Anyways... excuse meCOMMA I need to go do something,Well this has been fun KerensukiCOMMA but I need to curl my hair,Oops! Sorry I just remembered I have a bubble bath that I need to go attend,I forgot I have to go change my lightbulbsCOMMA they haven't changed out of their swimwear since this morning,Kerensuki,20
29,Hmpf...   You grew up middle class TrotsukiCOMMA I wouldn't start acting like you were a champion of the poor,You don't need to be of someone in order to speak up for them,I lived in North Sibarcticaland for a whileCOMMA I can make an educated guess,Then don't speak as if you represent all Rusubinians then,When the poor can speak for themselves I won't need to,Kerensuki,20
30,True enoughCOMMA I'm not like youCOMMA but I've put more public support into your community than you have,I don't like your implications,However you should avoid speaking of what you are ignorant of,There's just been no relevant time for me to bring up the issue in any of my public speeches,I have come out in support of the BundCOMMA it's just not widespread news,Kerensuki,20
31,And yet you left so quicklyCOMMA you even left your loved ones behind. All in order to write for the school paper at St. Gloriana Academy,They understoodCOMMA it's not like we hate each other or anything,And from that paper we inspired a new generation of socialists,I miss themCOMMA but they understand that inspiring the masses was for the greater good,Communism can require sacrificeCOMMA I am willing to do what it takes for the embetternent of the masses,Kerensuki,20
32,All for the greater good neh? I seem to remember your paper going through a civil war disuniting you even more,That was Renin's fault,Renin and I had some disagreementsCOMMA but we made up recently,We needed more peopleCOMMA unfortunately Renin thought differently,I guessCOMMA Renin thought they needed less members and I disagreedCOMMA if you want to call that a civil war then it was rather civil,Kerensuki,20
33,Mmm! Speaking of Renin when's she getting in today? I want to speak to her too.,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Kerensuki,15
34,Did you not know? I thought since you two got back to being good friendsCOMMA she would have told you when she's coming back.,Excuse meCOMMA I need to go do something,Well this has been fun KerensukiCOMMA but I need to curl my hair,Oops! Sorry I just remembered I have a bubble bath that I need to go attend,I forgot I have to go change my lightbulbsCOMMA they've been wearing their swimwear since this morning,Kerensuki,20
35,Wait Trotsuki! Is this about Renin? Is she back already? Talk to me Trotsuki! I command you to speak to me!!!,*walk faster*,*walk faster*,*walk faster*,*walk faster*,Kerensuki,15
36,UnderstandableCOMMA I hate when I don't do thatCOMMA they get all soggy. Ok have a nice day Trotsuki!~,Thanks! See you later!,Thanks! See you later!,Thanks! See you later!,Thanks! See you later!,Kerensuki,10
37,Says most of the upper management and a good portion of the students of this school.,They don't know any better,They just want to keep the students ignorant of good government,We don't have a good news systemCOMMA they're simply uninformed making the wrong choice,Upper management got where they are by abusing students with high costs,Kerensuki,20
38,True enoughCOMMA the students are pretty politically ingorant. That's one of the first things we want to change.,Change everyone's views to fit yours you mean,Inform them how great you are and how stinky the others are,Even if you did change things you'd never allow Marx to be taught,You wouldn't be teaching real political philosophy without teaching Marx,Kerensuki,15
39,A fair assessmentCOMMA we are planning to roll out changes to make living here more affordable for you poor unfortunate souls.,Affordable for the wealthy,So you say,By who's reckoning? Most of the Duma was wealthy land owners before this,Costs are a bourgeoisie fabricationCOMMA it would be better to implement communism,Kerensuki,20
40,If you don't believe us you are welcome to voice your disagreementsCOMMA but I think you'll find that we'll do a pretty good job,As if the bourgeoisie would allow dissenting opinions,You claim to allow different opinions nowCOMMA but come the time we shall see,If you haven't implemented communism then you aren't doing a good job,Socialism is a necessary first stepCOMMA that would start you off doing a good job,Kerensuki,15
41,Well if we weren't so committed to allowing different opinions why would we allow you and Renin back in here?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Renin was allowed back?,Kerensuki,15
42,You Marxists all love talking about communism neh? If communism is so good why isn't there a communism 2?,There were revisionist scumCOMMA but they got shut down,Depends on what you consider true communism,Communism hasn't been implemented yetCOMMA so there hasn't been a communism 1,A different communist theory could be considered communism 2,Kerensuki,15
43,HehehehCOMMA I'm just joking with you. I don't want to open that can of worms,...,...,...,...,Kerensuki,7
44,So uhCOMMA have you heard when Renin's getting in? I want to talk to her too.,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Kerensuki,15
45,Uh... Are you feeling ok there? Having a stroke? You just said a bunch of words and it sounded like gibberish?,QWERTYUIOP,ASDFGHJKL,ZXCVBNM,OKMIJNUHBYGV,Kerensuki,1
46,Hm? Did you just say something? You wanna repeat what you just said to me?,AS IF A CAPITALIST WOULD KNOW GOOD ECONOMICS,No,Just saying what a good person I think you are,...,Kerensuki,30
47,Really?,No,No,No,No,Kerensuki,30
48,Erhm... Yahallo?,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,YahalloCOMMA Kerensuki~,Kerensuki,30
49,Pardon me? No time for pork? I mean you can probably only afford bacon but you should always have time for a good tourtiere.,You're the pig in this scenario,Tourtiere is a dumb name,I have no time for French cooking,Oink Oink OinkCOMMA that's what you sound like,Kerensuki,30
50,You realize that while its not banned at the universityCOMMA it's discouraged to get too drunk to speak properly.,Who are you again?,Who are you again?,Who are you again?,Who are you again?,Kerensuki,30
51,Why yes I am a treasure aren't I? A treasure for a treasurer.,No wonder our economy is down the shitter,We are all treasures in our own wayCOMMA you're not special,Another byproduct of Nico spending money on worthless things,Treasures are worthless when one's basic needs aren't met,Kerensuki,30
52,Shut up.,...,...,...,...,Kerensuki,30
53,It's very rude to interrupt someone when they're spea...,this is so sadCOMMA Kerensuki play Katyusha,I don't care,The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that...,...,Kerensuki,30
54,Yeah I dunno what you just saidCOMMA but have you heard? Nico's been ousted. Georgia's running the Duma now.,Different face same policies.,That's worseCOMMA Nico at least never pretended to represent the people,Good Riddance,Nico needs to Nico Nico Neck herself,Kerensuki,30
55,Says the capitalist who is going to help the people of this land better than you ever could.,You're just wrong,Help yourself to the profits of their labour,Capitalism is an inherently flawed system,"Do the people know how you plan to ""help"" them?",Kerensuki,16
56,I guess being suspended isn't quite as dramatic as being expelled.,Cold is nothing as long as you have good people around youCOMMA but you have just had nothing to begin with,Drama is a distraction from saving the proletariat,It's easy to avoid harsh punishment when your daddy rules the school system,The Superintendent's daughter got suspended? How scandalous,Kerensuki,20
57,Righteous power will be given by the will of the peopleCOMMA not those who claim to be the will of the people.,I just so happen to be both,Sometimes the people don't know what's best for them,The will of the people is complicatedCOMMA it takes a certain type of person to interpret it,People are fickleCOMMA the will can change too quickly for anyone to carry it out if they do it as you intend to,Kerensuki,25
58,True enoughCOMMA that's why we're trying to change things.,Change is not inherently positive,Second verseCOMMA same as the first,The truth is trueCOMMA not simply partial,You're going to try and make things worse,Kerensuki,14
59,The pot really just went and called the kettle black then huh.,What do you mean?,I don't get that comparison,A kettle is blackCOMMA is it not?,That's racist,Kerensuki,15
60,The truth always hurts neh? But don't worry about itCOMMA you can always be better.,Lies hurt when people believe them,The truth is not always what it seems,You have no idea,An irrelevant tangent to what we were talking about beforeCOMMA shut up,Kerensuki,15
61,Fantastic retort...,Quiet,Same to you,ThanksCOMMA I think of it as some of my best work,...,Kerensuki,12
62,You know if you spent less time complaining about capitalism and more time actually helping peopleCOMMA they might like you more?,People already like me,But nobody will be helped in the long run unless we destroy capitalism,We are helping more people by weaving the threads to create communism,You really think so?,Kerensuki,15
63,We are making our plan forward no secretCOMMA we must turn Rusubina into a modern place of education.,The plan that you're fine with showing the public,Or so you say,We'll see...,Give it time,Kerensuki,15
64,I'm well aware thanks.,Ok great,Fantastic,Cool,Alright,Kerensuki,10
65,I would avoid speaking ill of my father considering how much he's helped your friends.,Your father is a very nice manCOMMA it's you I don't like,Well what's he ever done for me?,Just run back to daddy for protection like you always do,...,Kerensuki,15
66,Just proving how inadequate your party's rule would be.,That's simply incorrect,Counter-revolutionaries just don't understand the will of the people,People hate those who prove them wrong,You're inadequate,Kerensuki,15
67,Change things for the better I guess I could say.,Better for the rich,To better take advantage of the worker,Give it timeCOMMA we'll see your tune change real fast,If by better you mean worse,Kerensuki,17
68,I beg your pardon?,You heard what I said,Peter piper picked a patch of pickled puny paprika peppers,Unable to understand such a simple sentence? *Smug Chuckle* you're so dumb,I don't know either,Kerensuki,17
69,Don't worry about it.,I'm very concerned right now,That's not very convincing,WellCOMMA if you say so,Ok,Kerensuki,15
70,...,It is tho...,RACIST!,Hah! Racist destroyed with feelings and emotion!,Feeling too guilty to say anything neh? Get owned kiddo!,Kerensuki,15
71,...,...,...,...,...,Kerensuki,7
72,Oh sorry I didn't mean to make you... So how's life? Talked to Renin since she got back?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Renin is back too?,Kerensuki,15
73,You can keep telling yourself thatCOMMA but how many people outside your circle do you talk to who actually like you?,I could ask the same,More than you,Nico would supress news of us so not many people would know me,That... Am I really that abrasive?,Kerensuki,12
74,Yeah! You kinda come off as being only able to talk about communism.,But communism is my purpose in life,It will allow others to live wellCOMMA im willing to sacrifice a social life for that,WrongCOMMA I talk about socialism a lot too,Oh...,Kerensuki,15
75,Yeah... that's kinda sadCOMMA at least Renin has a social life.,Renin?,Renin?,Renin?,Renin?,Kerensuki,15
76,I just can't deal with you lot todayCOMMA my lifespan shortened enough by that short girl who wouldn't shut up about Renin.,Renin?,Renin?,Renin?,Renin?,Kerensuki,15
77,Yeah... Oh I meant to askCOMMA would you happen to know when she's getting in today? I meant to ask her some things.,She's coming here?,She's coming here?,She's coming here?,She's coming here?,Kerensuki,15
78,What have I ever done to you? Why do you dislike me so much?,The enemy of the proletariat asks why we may dislike her?,A spoiled brat such as yourself deserves no kindness from me,You look like the kind of person to put the milk in before the cereal,I dunnoCOMMA it must be your face,Kerensuki,15
79,Well his word alone changed the upper management's mind on allowing Renin back in hereCOMMA so he gave you time with a friend.,Renin is back in here?,Renin is back in here?,Renin is back in here?,Renin is back in here?,Kerensuki,15
80,You can't blame Nico for all your problems.,NoCOMMA I can now blame you,Watch me,To be fair she's at least responsible for most of them,YoU cAn'T bLaMe NiCo FoR aLl YoUr PrObLeMsCOMMA that's what you sound like,Kerensuki,15
81,She's supposed to get in today sometimeCOMMA do you know when?,Today?,Today?,Today?,Today?,Kerensuki,10
82,Well yeahCOMMA they have different facesCOMMA they're different people...,But remarkably similar in policy,But remarkably similar in policy,But remarkably similar in policy,But remarkably similar in policy,Kerensuki,30
83,Did... Did you just wait 5 minutes just to wait for a different dialogue tree?,YesCOMMA I am a sad person like that,YesCOMMA I am a sad person like that,YesCOMMA I am a sad person like that,YesCOMMA I am a sad person like that,Kerensuki,600
